        <p>
          We all know that Tiger and Sergio hated playing with each other, but
          they had no choice. You do! Foresome is the golf compatibility app
          that helps you find ideal golf partners, either at your local golf
          course or when you are on the road.

            <h3>Make the most of your vacation with Foresome</h3>
            <p>
              We have all been on vacation with a significant other and found
              ourselves staring out the hotel window at a championship golf
              course with no plans to play. Bummer. But not with Foresome. While
              your loved one hits the spa, you can hit the links by matching
              yourself with compatible golf partners so that you can make the
              most out of your vacation. Find your ideal foursome or partner
              with a similar handicap, gambling companion, or drinking buddy
              using our proprietary algorithm.

            <h3>Play golf on business trips with ease</h3>

            <p>
              Business trips can be a drag when none of your associates play
              golf and the conference is being held at a GOLF RESORT. But you
              never have to worry about that when you have Foresome. Instead of
              playing alone or risking getting paired with two slow pokes who
              can’t stop talking about their RV, you can use the app to find
              your ideal golf partners and make the most of your afternoon off.
              Stop wishing you had someone to play with and actually find
              someone to play with on Foresome.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let those other apps worry about finding you a life partner.
              Foresome will find you the perfect golf partners for 4 hours of
              fun (or whatever your pace of play preferences are).
